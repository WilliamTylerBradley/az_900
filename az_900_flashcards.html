This cloud service model is the closest to managing physical servers; a cloud provider will keep the hardware up-to-date, but operating system maintenance and network configuration is up to you as the cloud tenant. For example, Azure virtual machines are fully operational virtual compute devices running in Microsoft datacenters. An advantage of this cloud service model is rapid deployment of new compute devices. Setting up a new virtual machine is considerably faster than procuring, installing, and configuring a physical server.

This cloud service model is a managed hosting environment. The cloud provider manages the virtual machines and networking resources, and the cloud tenant deploys their applications into the managed hosting environment.

Like PaaS, serverless computing enables developers to build applications faster by eliminating the need for them to manage infrastructure. With serverless applications, the cloud service provider automatically provisions, scales, and manages the infrastructure required to run the code. Serverless architectures are highly scalable and event-driven, only using resources when a specific function or trigger occurs.

In this cloud service model, the cloud provider manages all aspects of the application environment, such as virtual machines, networking resources, data storage, and applications. The cloud tenant only needs to provide their data to the application managed by the cloud provider. For example, Microsoft Office 365 provides a fully working version of Microsoft Office that runs in the cloud. All you need to do is create your content, and Office 365 takes care of everything else.

There could be a cost to duplicating your services and transferring data between zones. Not every region has support. Availability zones are primarily for VMs, managed disks, load balancers, and SQL databases. Azure services that support availability zones fall into two categories: Zonal services, you pin the resource to a specific zone (VMs, managed disks), Zone-redundant services, the platform replicates automatically.

Resource groups exist to help manage and organize your Azure resources. By placing resources of similar usage, type, or location in a resource group, you can provide order and organization to resources you create in Azure. If you delete a resource group, all resources contained within it are also deleted. Organizing resources by life cycle can be useful in nonproduction environments, where you might try an experiment and then dispose of it. Resource groups make it easy to remove a set of resources all at once. Resource groups are also a scope for applying role-based access control (RBAC) permissions.

To manage costs for your expanding storage needs, it’s helpful to organize your data based on attributes like frequency of access and planned retention period. Data stored in the cloud can be different based on how it’s generated, processed, and accessed over its lifetime. Some data is actively accessed and modified throughout its lifetime. Some data is accessed frequently early in its lifetime, with access dropping drastically as the data ages. Some data remains idle in the cloud and is rarely, if ever, accessed after it’s stored. To accommodate these different access needs, Azure provides several access tiers, which you can use to balance your storage costs with your access needs.

<b> Serverless Computing Solutions Benefits </b><br> <br> <br>
</div>
<div class="fragment fade-in" data-fragment-index="1">
Serverless computing is a cloud-hosted execution environment that runs your code but abstracts the underlying hosting environment. The term serverless computing is a misnomer. After all, there is a server (or a group of servers) that executes your code or desired functionality. The key idea is that you’re not responsible for setting up or maintaining the server. You don’t have to worry about scaling it when there’s increased demand, and you don’t have to worry about outages. The cloud vendor takes care of all maintenance and scaling concerns for you.

You create an instance of the service, and you then add your code. No infrastructure configuration or maintenance is required, or even allowed. You configure your serverless apps to respond to events. An event could be a REST endpoint, a periodic timer, or even a message received from another Azure service. The serverless app runs only when it’s triggered by an event. Scaling and performance are handled automatically, and you’re billed only for the resources you use. You don’t even need to reserve resources.

You can host a single method or function by using a popular programming language in the cloud that runs in response to an event. An example of an event might be an HTTP request, a new message on a queue, or a message on a timer. The Azure Functions solution is ideal when you’re concerned only with the code that’s running your service and not the underlying platform or infrastructure. You use Azure Functions most commonly when you need to perform work in response to an event. You do this often via a REST request, timer, or message from another Azure service, and when that work can be completed quickly, within seconds or less.

Azure Logic Apps is designed in a web-based designer and can execute logic that’s triggered by Azure services without writing any code. You build an app by linking triggers to actions with connectors. A trigger is an event that causes an app to execute, then a new message to be sent to a queue, or an HTTP request. An action is a task or step that can execute. There are logic actions that work with variables, decision statements and loops, and tasks that parse and modify data. You can choose from over 200 connectors, including services such as Salesforce, SAP, Oracle DB, and file shares. If you can’t find the action or connector you need, you can build your own by using custom code.

<b> How Services Affect Costs </b><br> <br> <br>

When you provision a resource, Azure creates meters to track usage of that resource. Azure uses these meters to generate a usage record that’s later used to help calculate your bill. Each meter tracks a specific type of usage. For example, a meter might track bandwidth usage (ingress or egress network traffic in bits per second), number of operations, or its size (storage capacity in bytes). The usage that a meter tracks correlates to a quantity of billable units. Those units are charged to your account for each billing period. The rate per billable unit depends on the resource type you’re using.

<b> Azure Service Level Agreement (SLA) </b><br> <br> <br>
</div>
<div class="fragment fade-in" data-fragment-index="1">
A service-level agreement (SLA) is a formal agreement between a service company and the customer. For Azure, this agreement defines the performance standards that Microsoft commits to for you, the customer. Understanding the SLA for each Azure service you use helps you understand what guarantees you can expect. When you build applications on Azure, the availability of the services that you use affect your application’s performance. Understanding the SLAs involved can help you establish the SLA you set with your customers.

<b> Actions That Can Impact an SLA </b><br> <br> <br>
</div>
<div class="fragment fade-in" data-fragment-index="1">
To achieve maximum availability in your application, add redundancy to every single part of the application. This redundancy includes the application itself, as well as the underlying services and infrastructure. Be aware, however, that doing so can be difficult and expensive, and often results in solutions that are more complex than they need to be.

<b> Service Lifecycle in Azure (Public Preview and General Availability) </b><br> <br> <br>
</div>
<div class="fragment fade-in" data-fragment-index="1">
The service lifecycle defines how every Azure service is released for public use. Every Azure service starts in the development phase. The Azure team collects and defines its requirements, and begins to build the service. Next, the service is released to the public preview phase. During this phase, the public can access and experiment with it so that it can provide feedback. Providing feedback gives you the opportunity to request new or different capabilities so that services better meet your needs. After a new Azure service is validated and tested, it’s released to all customers as a production-ready service known as general availability (GA).
